# cluster tools
This package provides tools of clustering evaluation for Python language. `sklearn` does not have methods of clustering evaluation enough. For example, 
* cluster assignment by Hungarian algorithm
* stability

are very important for results of clustering, but we cannot check them with `sklearn`.
